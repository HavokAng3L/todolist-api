# todolist-api
This is the backend for my todolist app. Built with Express.js, mongoose for db connection and MongoDB for the database.

Running ontop of the Node.Js runtime enviornment.

Learned about REST style communication between applications, HTTP methods and headers, and the MVC design pattern.
